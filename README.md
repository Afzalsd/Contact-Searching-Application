# Contact Searching Application

**Description**:
Develop a command-line application that allows users to manage and search through their contacts efficiently.

**Features**:

1. **Add Contacts**: Allow users to add new contacts with details such as name, phone number, email, etc.
2. **Search Contacts**: Implement efficient search functionality to find contacts based on name, phone number, or any other attribute.
3. **Delete Contacts**: Allow users to delete contacts from their list.
4. **Update Contacts**: Enable users to update contact information.
5. **Display Contacts**: Provide an option to display all contacts in the address book.

**Implementation**:

1. **Data Structures**:
    - **Hash Table**: Use a hash table to store contacts for fast retrieval. Hashing can be based on the first few characters of the contact's name to enable efficient searching.
    - **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Optionally, you can use a binary search tree to store contacts sorted by name for quick searching and displaying in alphabetical order.
2. **Search Algorithms**:
    - **Hashing**: Implement a hash function to quickly locate contacts based on their attributes.
    - **Binary Search (for BST)**: If using a binary search tree, implement binary search algorithms to find contacts efficiently.
3. **User Interface**:
    - Design a simple command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the application.
    - Provide clear instructions and menu options for adding, searching, updating, and deleting contacts.
4. **Error Handling**:
    - Implement error handling to deal with cases such as duplicate contacts, invalid input, or when a contact is not found.

**Additional Features (Optional)**:

1. **Fuzzy Search**: Implement fuzzy search functionality to allow users to find contacts even with minor typos or variations in the search query.
2. **Import/Export Contacts**: Allow users to import contacts from a file (e.g., VCF) or export contacts to a file for backup or sharing purposes.
3. **Contact Groups**: Enable users to categorize contacts into different groups (e.g., friends, family, colleagues) and search within specific groups.

**Technologies**:

- Language: C++ for core implementation.
- Libraries: Standard C++ libraries for data structures and algorithms.
- Optional: Third-party libraries for advanced functionalities like fuzzy search.

**Conclusion**:
Building a contact searching application provides hands-on experience in implementing data structures like hash tables and binary search trees, as well as algorithms for efficient searching. It's a practical project that can be expanded with additional features to enhance its usability and functionality.
